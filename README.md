# tradingbot
The goal of this project was to create a trading bot that would not be losing money. I traded on historical data from s&p 500. 
Example of how the results looked:

I added the sharpe ratio to have a better understanding of how well the model with optimized parameters was performing

While optimizing, I used a plot to see how the model was performing and compared the results of many different stocks to be sure that it isn't ovefitting

Then I used the model on the data from 2010 to 2020 on the whole s&p500 (excluding 2 stocks that were not available in the data):
